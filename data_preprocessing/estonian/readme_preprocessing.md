# Preprocessing of the Estonian datasets

The current Estonian dataset consists of recordings from https://koneveeb.ee/korpused/. For testing purposes, I selected 6 speakers with 1 to 2 hours each, much more is available.

preprocess_wavs.py does silence trimming, f0 extraction, volume normalization, downsampling, and metadata creation.
